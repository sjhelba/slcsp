Calculate second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP)
================================================

You have been asked to determine the second lowest cost silver plan for a group
of ZIP Codes. (The SCLSP is the "benchmark" health plan in a particular area --
it is used to compute the tax credit that qualifying individuals and families
receive on the marketplace.)

Task
----

You have been given a CSV file (`slcsp.csv`) containing the ZIP Codes in one
column. Fill in the second column with the rate of the corresponding SLCSP.
Your answer is the modified CSV file, plus any source code used. (Write your
code in your best programming language or languages.) The order of the rows in
the file must stay the same. If no SLCSP can be determined for a ZIP Code, leave
the cell blank (no quotes or other text).

It may not be possible to determine a SLCSP for every ZIP Code given -- what
reason or reasons are there? Fill in your explanation(s) below.

    Reason:

    1) ???

    2) ???

Notes
-----

A plan has a "metal level", which can be Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or
Catastrophic -- this indicates the level of coverage the plan provides.

A plan has a "rate", which is the amount of the monthly premium in dollars.

A plan has a "rate area", which is a geographic region within a state in which
that plan's rate is valid.

There are two additional CSV files in this directory besides `slcsp.csv` --
`plans.csv`, containing all the health plans in the U.S. on the marketplace, and
`zips.csv`, containing a mapping of ZIP Code to county/counties & rate area(s).

A ZIP Code can potentially be in more than one county.
